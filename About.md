Hi!

I am Hari, an energy system modeler and data scientist. I will be starting as a research engineer in the Grid Planning and Analysis Center at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab in early September. Previously, I completed my PhD from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I was advised by Prof. [Michael Craig](https://seas.umich.edu/research/faculty/michael-craig).

I am interested in studying climate impacts on natural & man-made systems, and building computational tools and models to do so. During my PhD I focussed on research at the intersection of power system decarbonization, system reliability, and mitigation & adaptation challenges due to a changing climate. 

More details on my projects and codes are in the [research](/research) and [codes](/codes) pages, and in my [scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uQAgcREAAAAJ&hl=en) page. Born and raised in Chennai, India and I did my under grad in Materials Engineering at IIT Madras. I began my research pursuits in materials informatics and solid mechanics, and you can find more about that [here](/materials).
