Hi!

I am Srihari (Hari) Sundar, a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I work in the [ASSET lab](https://www.assetlab.org) where I am advised by [Prof. Michael Craig](https://seas.umich.edu/research/faculty/michael-craig).
My research interests include decarbonization of the power sector, climate impacts, computational modeling, and sustainable transformation. My current research is focused on predicting changes in the energy system -- meteorology interaction with a transition to widespread renewable energy generation, and using this to inform long term planning of reliable power systems under a changing climate while ensuring a just transition. I am also passionate about building scalable software and contributing to the open-source ecosystem.

Born and raised in Chennai, India and I did my under grad in Materials Engineering at IIT Madras. I began my research pursuits in materials informatics and data driven modeling, before changing fields.
