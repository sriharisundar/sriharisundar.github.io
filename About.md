Hi!

I am Srihari Sundar, a PhD candidate in the aerospace engineering department at the University of Michigan. I work in the [ASSET lab](https://www.assetlab.org) and I am co-advised by Prof. Michael Craig and [Prof. Ashley Payne](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/ashley-payne/). My research focus is on effects of climate change and variability on the reliability of power systems. Specifically, I study the effects of changing frequency and intensity of compound events affecting the operation of electricity generators and flexibility needs of the system in a decarbonized future.

I am also interested in science policy and sustainability, and spend a lot of time thinking about these topics. Through my involvement in a campus group called [ESPA](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/espa-umich) (Engaging Scientists in Policy and Advocacy) and I also work on writing policy recommendations and analyses for a variety of science and technology issues. 

I was born and raised in Chennai, India and studied Materials Engineering during my undergrad. Subsequently I began my research pursuits in materials informatics and data driven modeling, before changing fields. More details on my projects are in the research page and my CV.
