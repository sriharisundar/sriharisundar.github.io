Hi!

I am Srihari Sundar, a first year PhD student in the aerospace engineering department at the University of Michigan. I work in the [multiscale structural simulations laboratory](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~veeras/) under the guidance of Prof. Veera Sundararaghavan. My research interests encompass mechanical behavior of materials, multiscale modeling, and high performance computing. Click here to read about my current and previous projects in detail.
